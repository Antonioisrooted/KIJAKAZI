                    A mentorship is a relationship between two people where the individual with more experience, knowledge, 
                    and connections is able to pass along what they have learned to a more junior individual within a certain field.
                    Mentorship promotes, advocates and is a resource for mentoring.

                    A mentor can help you advance within your field and connect you with opportunities that you might not have otherwise had access to. 
                    They do this by sharing their knowledge, helping you identify opportunities in your path, and potentially opening doors for you when the time comes.
